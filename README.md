# State-Generator

Bedrock block state typings generator!

Working on a converter to get proper typings for Bedrock block states. I got the JSON file with these values from @PMK744, I'm working on making them more traversable, then I can group them together by their block ID, and make a union type for each of the similarly-named properties.
